Winter Semester 22-23, Engineering Chemistry Digital Assignment.
Program 1 - Write a program to predict the thermal stability of 5 organometallic substances by 
taking ΔH°f and TΔS from the user by using for loop and arrays to take the input of 
the data and to print the result. (thermStability.java)

Program 2 - Around 50 water samples collected from different regions of Agra were found to be 
contaminated with Cr6+ ions. Convert the normality of the samples taken from the 
user to ppm for all samples. Write a Java program for the above problem using arrays to take the input of data’s and 
to print the result.(normality.java)
